# BCG Open-Access Data Science & Advanced Analytics Virtual Experience Program via Forage
## Introduction 
PowerCo is a major gas and electricity utility that supplies to corporate, SME (Small & Medium Enterprise), and residential customers. The power-liberalization of the energy market in Europe has led to significant customer churn, especially in the SME segment. Their goal is to diagnose the source of churning SME customers.

## Data Source
The datasets are downloaded from [BCG Open-Access Data Science & Advanced Analytics Virtual Experience Program](https://www.theforage.com/virtual-internships/prototype/Tcz8gTtprzAS4xSoK/GAMMA-Virtual-Experience-Program?ref=bbzMdAupS8YnE3DsR)
The datasets include:
Historical customer data: Customer data such as usage, sign up date, forecasted usage, etc
Historical pricing data: variable and fixed pricing data etc
Churn indicator: whether each customer has churned or not

## Task 1 Exploratory Data Analysis & Data Cleaning
In this task, the data was cleaned by addressing missing values, duplicates, data type conversions, transformations, and multicolinearity, as well as outliers. 
Exploratory data analysis has been performed to get insights. 

## Task 2 Feature Engineering 
To achieve better performance of machine learning model, feature engineering was performed. 
The techniques used are log transform, one-hot coding and imputation, etc. 

## Task 3 Modeling and Evaluation
The churn model was built with XGboost to predict churn probability.
